Lately, I've been struggling on deciciding the next project in Machine Learning that I'll handle
Part of my struggle has been playing the Ludo game which is actually one of my favorite games of all time. 
Unlike the previous one in Java, I wanted to create a GUI for this one, so I hard to use a library in Python known as Tkinter.
 It provides a powerful Object-Oriented Interface and is easy to use. 
 At the end of the development, the app should allow the user to roll the dice, generate random numbers and change the dice photo according to the picture selected.
 I used Jupyter Notebook for this project, so you may really consider that before running the file.
 I am not quite familiar if jupyter notebooks could also run as python files, but you can always extract the code otherwise.
 Below is a screenshot for how the program works!!

 With time, I want to carefully incorporate the feature like the famous Ludo game, with four players and a home destination for each.
 I was however successful to create the layout of the stimulator and understand a few things about how the game works.
